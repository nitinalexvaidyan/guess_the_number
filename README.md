# __Guess The Number - Python Game__
A simple Python game where the computer tries to guess a number that the user is thinking of within a given range. The user provides feedback, and the computer adjusts its guesses accordingly.

***Working***
The user inputs the highest number (N), and the game will guess between 1 and N.
The computer makes a guess and asks for feedback:
Enter 'C' → If the guessed number is correct.
Enter 'H' → If the guessed number is too high.
Enter 'L' → If the guessed number is too low.
The game continues until the computer correctly guesses the number.

***Sample Run***
Please input the highest number in which the guess to be made between 1 and that number? 50
The guessed number is 25. If the guessed number is correct enter 'C', if higher 'H' and if lower 'L' H
The guessed number is 12. If the guessed number is correct enter 'C', if higher 'H' and if lower 'L' L
The guessed number is 18. If the guessed number is correct enter 'C', if higher 'H' and if lower 'L' C
Yay! Found the number !!! ... It is 18

***Features***
Randomized guessing for efficiency
Interactive user feedback system
Simple and fun to play!
